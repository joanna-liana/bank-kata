# Bank Kata

Apart from the kata solution, the code includes a test written for Node's native test runner.

Use `make node_test` to run it.

## Description

https://katalyst.codurance.com/bank

## Instructions

Write a class named Account that implements the following public interface:

```
public interface AccountService {
    void deposit(int amount)
    void withdraw(int amount)
    void printStatement()
}
```

You cannot change the public interface of this class.

Here's the specification for an acceptance test that expresses the desired behaviour for this

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012

**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012

**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012

**When** they print their bank statement

**Then** they would see:

```
Date       || Amount || Balance
14/01/2012 || -500   || 2500
13/01/2012 || 2000   || 3000
10/01/2012 || 1000   || 1000
```

We're using ints for the money amounts to keep the auxiliaries as simple as possible. In a real system, we would always use a datatype with guaranteed arbitrary precision, but doing so here would distract from the main purpose of the exercise.
Don't worry about spacing and indentation in the statement output. (You could instruct your acceptance test to ignore whitespace if you wanted to.)
